What is angular?
    - angular is a javascript framework which allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications

What is a Single Page Application?
 - an app that can seem to have multiple pages, but is available at one address
 - every change is rendered in the browser
    - this gives the user a very reactive user experience 
    - it allows you to create web apps that look and feel very fast, everything happens fast 
    - if the user needs data from the server, you load the data in the background and the user never leaves this experience 
 - the JavaScript changes the DOM so new data is shown to the user

What is a DOM? 
DOM = Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface
DOM is a model of a document with an associated API for manipulating it. 
HTML is a markup language that lets you represent a certain kind of DOM in text.
CSS is the style that is applied to the HTML document

What is a CLI? 
CLI = Command Line Interface

A new version of Angular is released every 6 months

Common Angular commands
 - create a new project: ng new
 - run the project with: ng serve
 - angular runs on port: 4200 by default

Where can you find all the dependencies of your project?
In the package.json

What is the structure of the package.json file?
    - "dependencies" - the dependencies that the app needs to work correctly
    - "devDependencies" - the dependencies only required for development

What is node_modules used for? 
    - is where all the dependencies declared in the package.json file were installed

In the src -> app is the actual source code

What is the structure of a component
    - .html     - the template
    - .css      - the styling file
    - .ts       - a typescript file
    - .spec.ts  - a file for tests

Angular lets you mix static html and dynamic things

What is TypeScript
    - is a super set to JavaScript
    - it offers more features than JavasScript, like:
        - classes 
        - interfaces
        - strong typing
    - Typescript code is compiled Javascript code by the CLI 


@Component
    - selector
    - template
    - styleUrls

Types of binding in angular:
    - Interpolation (one way binding) - {{title}}
    - Property Binding (one way binding) - <button [disabled] ="isDisabled">I am a button</button>
    - Event Binding (one way binding) - e.g. perform an action when a user cicks a button. (click) = "saveUser()"
    - Two Way Binding - [(someProperty)]="value"
